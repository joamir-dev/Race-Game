# Thunder Race Game

Welcome to **Thunder Race**, a fast-paced racing game created using **Unity**. This game was developed as part of a tutorial to help me learn Unity game development and as my first trial project using the Unity engine.

## Overview

**Thunder Race** is a simple racing game where players control a car and race against time on a challenging track. The goal is to complete the track in the shortest time possible while avoiding obstacles.

This game was created using Unity's built-in templates, and it serves as both a learning exercise and an introduction to game mechanics such as car movement, physics, and collision detection in Unity.

## Features

- **Basic Racing Mechanics**: Drive a car on a track with functional physics.
- **Time-Based Racing**: Race against the clock to complete the track in the fastest time.
- **Simple Controls**: Easy-to-learn controls for a fun racing experience.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in Unity or build it to your platform of choice (e.g., Windows, macOS).
2. Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the car's movement:
   - **Up Arrow / W**: Accelerate
   - **Down Arrow / S**: Brake/Reverse
   - **Left Arrow / A**: Steer Left
   - **Right Arrow / D**: Steer Right
3. Try to complete the race track in the shortest time while avoiding obstacles.
4. The game will end when you finish the track or collide with an obstacle.

## Getting Started

To run the game on your local machine:

1. Download the project files.
2. Open the project in **Unity**.
3. Click on the **Play** button in the Unity editor to start the game.
4. Alternatively, build the game by selecting **File > Build Settings** and choose your target platform.

## My First Trial Game

This game was created as my first trial Unity project. It was a valuable learning experience, helping me understand key Unity concepts like:

- **Physics and Car Movement**: Using Unity's physics engine to simulate realistic car movement.
- **Collisions and Obstacles**: Handling collisions and adding obstacles to the racing track.
- **User Interface**: Implementing basic UI elements such as timers and score tracking.
  
I hope this serves as a starting point for further improvements and more complex game projects in Unity.
